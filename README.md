QR Code-Based Smart Office Seat Allocation System

Overview

This system enables efficient and real-time office seat allocation and management through QR codes. It provides an easy way for employees to reserve, check in, and check out office seats using a dynamic QR code scanning system. The platform is built with Flask/Django for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and PostgreSQL/MySQL for database management. It integrates WebSockets/Firebase for real-time seat updates and OTP validation for security.

 Features

- Real-time Seat Allocation: Employees can check-in/check-out and reserve office seats in real-time.
- Dynamic QR Codes: Unique QR codes are generated for each seat and can be scanned for seat reservation and check-in.
- OTP Validation: OTP is sent to employees for secure seat reservation and check-in.
- Admin Dashboard: HR/Admin can manage seat allocations and monitor seat availability in real-time.
- Database Integration: PostgreSQL/MySQL stores check-in times and seat statuses (Occupied/Available).
- WebSocket/Firebase Integration: Enables real-time seat status updates for all users.

 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Flask/Django
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets/Firebase
- QR Code Generation: UniQode API

 Installation

 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (for database)

 Setup Instructions

 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-office-seat-management.git
cd qr-code-office-seat-management
```

 2. Backend Setup (Flask/Django)

- Install the required dependencies for the backend:
  
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

- Setup the PostgreSQL/MySQL database and configure the connection settings in `backend/config.py`.
- Run the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

- Start the backend server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

 3. Frontend Setup (React.js)

- Install the required dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

- Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

 4. Real-time WebSocket/Firebase Setup

- Follow the instructions to set up Firebase/Socket server for real-time communication.
- Add Firebase credentials in `backend/firebase_config.py` or configure WebSocket server in `backend/socket_config.py`.

 5. QR Code Integration

- Integrate UniQode or another QR code generation API in the backend to dynamically generate QR codes for seats.
- Make sure the QR code includes a unique ID that links to the seat reservation system.

 Usage

- Employees can scan the QR code displayed on each seat to check in or reserve the seat.
- Admins can manage seat reservations, monitor occupancy, and track check-in times through the admin dashboard.
- Real-time updates of seat availability are shown instantly for both employees and admins.
